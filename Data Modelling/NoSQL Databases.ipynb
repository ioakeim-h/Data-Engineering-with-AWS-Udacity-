    "<li>Apache Cassandra (Partition Row Store) - data is distributed by partitions across nodes or servers and is organised in a columns-rows format</li>\n",
    "<li>MongoDB (Document store) - stores and queries data in JSON-like documents</li>\n",
    "<li>DynamoDB (Key-Value store) - data represented as a collection of key-value pairs</li>\n",
    "<li>Apache HBase (Wide Column store) - uses tables, rows, and columns but column name and formats can vary from row to row in the same table</li>\n",
    "<li>Neo4j (Graph Database) - relationships between entities is the main focus</li>\n",
